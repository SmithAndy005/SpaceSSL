## Self Supervised Learning for the Exploration of Large Unlabelled Datasets

Blurb

The use of this modeling technique in space environment physics has been submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics as a methods paper demonstrating its utility on unlabelled data from spacecraft and ground based auroral imagers.

## Requirements

We provide a [requirements txt](/requirements.txt) and [conda yml](/environment.yml) file from the machine used development of the models in Smith et al., (2023, in prep).  However, in short the requirements can all be installed through pip, with the main packages for training being:

- torch
- lightly
- torchvision
- math

with extra packages for visualisation:

- matplotlib
